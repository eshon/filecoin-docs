# Calibration

{% hint style="info" %}
Also see [Calibration RPCs](rpcs.md) and [Calibration Explorers](explorers.md).
{% endhint %}

Prospective storage providers can experience more realistic sealing performance and hardware requirements using final proofs constructions and parameters. Storage clients can store and retrieve _real data_ on the network. Clients can also participate in deal-making workflows and storage and retrieval functionality. The sector size on the Calibration testnet is the same as on the Filecoin mainnet; 32 GiB and 64 GiB sectors are supported. This testnet also includes the Filecoin EVM-runtime features found on the Filecoin mainnet.

Developers can reference pre-existing deals that are already available on the network. See the [`#fil-net-calibration-discuss` channel in the Filecoin Slack](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C01D42NNLMS) for support.

## Active storage providers <a href="#active-storage-providers" id="active-storage-providers"></a>

The following storage providers are running on the Calibration testnet.

### [PiKNiK](https://github.com/benjaminh83/fvm-calib-deal-miners) <a href="#piknikhttpsgithubcombenjaminh83fvm-calib-deal-miners" id="piknikhttpsgithubcombenjaminh83fvm-calib-deal-miners"></a>

* **t017840**: Every deal accepted by this SP will be aggregated into 32 GiB sectors, which is the minimum size for calibration network. This miner has a preset sealing capacity of 2x 32 GiB sectors per day, defined as sectors in waitdeals will be flushed every 12 hours.
