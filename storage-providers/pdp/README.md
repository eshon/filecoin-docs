**DEPRECATED DEVELOPER TOOL**\
\
This documentation refers to the legacy `pdptool`, which is intended only for low-level developer testing.\
It is not the recommended method for onboarding or interacting with PDP Storage Providers.

For current usage, including working with live PDP SPs and submitting real deals, please use the [Synapse SDK](https://github.com/FilOzone/synapse-sdk) and [Synapse dApp Tutorial](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fs-upload-dapp).
{% endhint %}
