# Storage onramps

Developers use web UIs, APIs, or libraries to send data to storage onramps. Behind the scenes, storage onramps receive the data and handle the underlying processes to store it in a reliable and decentralized storage way by saving it [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech) nodes, making deals with Filecoin storage providers â€“ or both. You can use the same APIs or other tools to retrieve data quickly.

The available storage onramps are: 

* [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse.storage/) "offers permanent, decentralized storage powered by Filecoin. Secure, scalable, and ideal for individuals, developers, and enterprises."
* [Akave](https://www.akave.ai/) is "revolutionizing data management with a decentralized, modular solution that combines the robust storage of Filecoin with cutting-edge encryption and easy-to-use interfaces."  
* [Storacha](https://storacha.network/) is an open hot storage network scales IPFS and Filecoin. Upload any data and Storacha will ensure it ends up on a decentralized set of IPFS and Filecoin storage providers. There Storacha [docs](https://docs.storacha.network/) detail the JavaScript and Go API libraries, and there is a no-code web uploader available as well.
* [Singularity](https://singularity.storage/) "facilitates onboarding of large quantaties of data (PB-scale) to the Filecoin network in an efficient, secure, and flexible way."
* [CID Gravity](https://www.cidgravity.com/) is a "seamless gateway to the decentralized web", allowing you to drag and drop files through an easy-to-use UI that uploads files to Filecoin and IPFS.  
* [Ramo](https://www.ramo.io/) is "a network coordinating people, hardware and capital to build a more open and resilient internet infrastructure for everyone."
