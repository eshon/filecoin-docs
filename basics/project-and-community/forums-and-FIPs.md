# Discussion Forums and Filecoin Improvement Proposals

### Discussion Forums

For shorter-lived discussions, our community chat open to all on both Slack and Discord:

* [Slack](https://filecoinproject.slack.com)
* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/filecoin)

For long-lived discussions and for support, please use the [discussion tab on GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community#forums) instead of Slack. Itâ€™s easy for complex discussions to get lost in a sea of new messages on those chat platforms, and posting longer discussions and support requests on the forums helps future visitors, too.

### Filecoin improvement proposals

Filecoin improvement proposals (FIPs) are design documents that propose changes and improvements to the Filecoin network, giving detailed specifications and their rational, and allowing the community to document their consensus or dissent.  All technical FIPs that are accepted are later reflected in the [Filecoin Spec](https://spec.filecoin.io/).

There are three types of FIPs:
* Technical FIPs (FTP): protocol changes, standards, API changes.  They can include core (consensus-related changes, networking (network protocol improvements, interface (API/RPC or language-level updates), or can be informational (updates to general guidelines or documentation).
* Organizational FIPs (FOP): changes to processes, tools, or governance.
* Recovery FIPs (FRP): emergency fixes requiring state changes (e.g., major bugs).

Typically, the FIP lifecycle looks something like this:

[ WIP ] -> [ DRAFT ] -> [ LAST CALL ] -> [ ACCEPTED ] -> [ FINAL ]

1. WIP: A community member has an idea for a FIP, and begins discussing the idea publicly on the Filecoin Discord, in the [Filecoin Slack channel for discussing FIPs](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C01EU76LPCJ), or in Github issues for the relevant repo.
2. DRAFT: If there is a chance the FIP could be adopted, the author submits a draft for the FIP as a pull request in the [FIPs repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs).
3. LAST CALL: This status allows the community to submit final changes to the draft.
4. ACCEPTED: Once the FIP is voted on and accepted, the core engineers will work to implement it.
5. FINAL: This status represents the current state-of-the-art, and it should only be updated to correct errors.

It is the authors' responsibility to request status updates for the FIP.  A more robust explainer of the FIP process can be found in [FIP001](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0001.md#what-is-a-fip).
